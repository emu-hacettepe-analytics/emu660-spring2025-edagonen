[***Hello! I'm Eda Gönen.***]{style="color:#9932cc"}

Welcome to my personal website! Here, I share my work in data analytics, blog posts, and a few different projects. I enjoy working with data and finding new ways to understand it. I’ll also be sharing my thoughts on technology from time to time.

Stay tuned, there’s plenty to discover and learn together!
