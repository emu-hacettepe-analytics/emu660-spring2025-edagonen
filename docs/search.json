    "text": "Kerem Demirta≈ü is a Data Scientist currently working at Invent Analytics. Previously, he worked at Spyke Games and Smart Kiwi. One of his significant projects was Royal Reachers, where he focused on analyzing users‚Äô gaming behaviors and demographic structures to deliver the most suitable offers at the most optimal times, thereby maximizing sales. Later in his career, he contributed to a project aimed at optimizing inventory management in retail. This involved developing software that determines how much stock should be held at various locations and for which models, ultimately helping businesses maximize their sales.\nHis research interests revolve around autonomous vehicles, traffic flow modeling, transportation simulations, and optimization techniques in mobility systems.\n\n\n\nData science finds applications in various fields, including:\n\nEpidemiology: Predicting the likelihood of disease outbreaks, identifying high-risk regions, and implementing preventive measures.\nRetail: Optimizing stock levels and sales strategies to enhance profitability.\nAutonomous Vehicles: Improving traffic efficiency, reducing congestion, and enhancing the decision-making capabilities of self-driving cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not merely an exaggerated form of statistics.\nIt is not just about building models.\nIt is not exclusively tied to Big Data.\nWriting Python code does not make someone a data analyst.\nData analysis does not always provide definitive answers to every question.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem Identification: Clearly defining the problem is the first step in data science. A historical example of this is the analysis conducted during World War II on aircraft durability. Engineers initially focused on reinforcing the most frequently damaged parts of returning planes, but statistician Abraham Wald proposed a different approach‚Äîsuggesting that undamaged areas of returning planes were actually where the planes that were shot down had suffered critical damage. This shift in thinking led to more effective reinforcement strategies.\nData Collection: Gathering unbiased data is crucial. Abraham Wald‚Äôs unbiased thinking methodology is a key example. His research showed that survivorship bias can mislead analyses if data from unsuccessful cases (e.g., planes that didn‚Äôt return) is not considered.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before building models, it is essential to understand and visualize the data. A classic example is John Snow‚Äôs study on cholera outbreaks in 1854 London. By mapping out cases and identifying contaminated water sources, he demonstrated that cholera was waterborne‚Äîlong before germ theory was widely accepted. This showcases how data visualization and pattern recognition can lead to groundbreaking discoveries.\nModel Building: At this stage, predictive and analytical models are developed. A relevant example is Lewis Fry Richardson‚Äôs pioneering work on weather forecasting, where he proposed numerical methods for predicting atmospheric conditions. Another example is the World War II Diet Problem, which used linear programming to optimize military rations by balancing nutrition and cost.\nModel Evaluation: Assessing model performance and avoiding overfitting are crucial aspects of data science. Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise instead of actual patterns, reducing its real-world applicability. An illustrative case is the Deep Blue vs.¬†Garry Kasparov chess match, where the AI was trained to analyze millions of moves but had to generalize its strategies to defeat a world champion.\nProduction and Live Performance: Once a model is finalized, it must be deployed in a real-world setting. This step involves monitoring AI tools and ensuring their effectiveness. Examples include AI-driven recommendation systems in e-commerce, self-learning fraud detection systems in banking, and real-time traffic prediction tools in transportation networks.\n\n\n\n\nHis thesis, ‚ÄúObject-driven Cellular Automaton Model for Platooning of Autonomous Vehicles on Freeways with Multiple Lanes‚Äù, explores how autonomous vehicles can form convoys and adapt to complex road conditions. The primary motivation behind his research is to minimize the following distance between vehicles, optimize acceleration and deceleration during lane changes, and reduce the impact of stop-and-go waves in traffic flow. By refining the mechanics of platooning, his work contributes to the development of more efficient and safer autonomous driving systems.\nUltimately, his work highlights the power of data science in solving complex real-world problems, from optimizing business operations to transforming the future of mobility.",

    "text": "The Role of Data Science and Its Applications: Insights from Kerem Demirta≈ü\nKerem Demirta≈ü is a Data Scientist currently working at Invent Analytics. Previously, he worked at Spyke Games and Smart Kiwi. One of his significant projects was Royal Reachers, where he focused on analyzing users‚Äô gaming behaviors and demographic structures to deliver the most suitable offers at the most optimal times, thereby maximizing sales. Later in his career, he contributed to a project aimed at optimizing inventory management in retail. This involved developing software that determines how much stock should be held at various locations and for which models, ultimately helping businesses maximize their sales.\nHis research interests revolve around autonomous vehicles, traffic flow modeling, transportation simulations, and optimization techniques in mobility systems.",

    "section": "The Data Science Workflow",
    "text": "The Data Science Workflow\n\nProblem Identification: Clearly defining the problem is the first step in data science. A historical example of this is the analysis conducted during World War II on aircraft durability. Engineers initially focused on reinforcing the most frequently damaged parts of returning planes, but statistician Abraham Wald proposed a different approach‚Äîsuggesting that undamaged areas of returning planes were actually where the planes that were shot down had suffered critical damage. This shift in thinking led to more effective reinforcement strategies.\nData Collection: Gathering unbiased data is crucial. Abraham Wald‚Äôs unbiased thinking methodology is a key example. His research showed that survivorship bias can mislead analyses if data from unsuccessful cases (e.g., planes that didn‚Äôt return) is not considered.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before building models, it is essential to understand and visualize the data. A classic example is John Snow‚Äôs study on cholera outbreaks in 1854 London. By mapping out cases and identifying contaminated water sources, he demonstrated that cholera was waterborne‚Äîlong before germ theory was widely accepted. This showcases how data visualization and pattern recognition can lead to groundbreaking discoveries.\nModel Building: At this stage, predictive and analytical models are developed. A relevant example is Lewis Fry Richardson‚Äôs pioneering work on weather forecasting, where he proposed numerical methods for predicting atmospheric conditions. Another example is the World War II Diet Problem, which used linear programming to optimize military rations by balancing nutrition and cost.\nModel Evaluation: Assessing model performance and avoiding overfitting are crucial aspects of data science. Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise instead of actual patterns, reducing its real-world applicability. An illustrative case is the Deep Blue vs.¬†Garry Kasparov chess match, where the AI was trained to analyze millions of moves but had to generalize its strategies to defeat a world champion.\nProduction and Live Performance: Once a model is finalized, it must be deployed in a real-world setting. This step involves monitoring AI tools and ensuring their effectiveness. Examples include AI-driven recommendation systems in e-commerce, self-learning fraud detection systems in banking, and real-time traffic prediction tools in transportation networks.",
