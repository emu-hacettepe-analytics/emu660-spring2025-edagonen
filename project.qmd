## *1.Project Overview and Scope*

In this project, we aim to analyze how different movie genres perform in terms of audience preferences. Our primary focus is to identify genre-based patterns in film popularity and ratings, using a data-driven approach. To make the analysis more meaningful and localized, we enriched a widely-used global movie dataset by merging it with a Turkish-specific movie dataset. Through this project, we plan to discover whether certain genres are more successful among audiences and if factors like production year, runtime, or budget have a significant effect on genre-based popularity.

## *2.Data*

We based our analysis on a combined dataset. The core dataset is *ggplot2movies*, which includes information about thousands of films worldwide.\

To create a more localized perspective, we merged this dataset with a Turkish movie dataset.\

The combined data allowed us to create new variables, such as Turkish-specific ratings and popularity scores, which we will use in our comparative analysis.

### *2.1 Data Source*

-   The global movie data is sourced from the open-access *ggplot2movies* dataset, widely used in data analysis and visualization projects.

-   The Turkish-specific data was obtained from Kaggle, specifically from the [Turkish Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emreokcular/turkish-movies) shared by Emre Okçular.

-   Both datasets provide rich information such as film titles, genres, production years, runtimes, IMDb ratings, and other useful attributes for our analysis.

### 2.*2 General Information About Data*

### 2.*3 Reasons of Choice*

We selected this dataset because it offers a rich and diverse set of information about movies across different genres and periods.\

The global *ggplot2movies* dataset provides a well-organized structure for large-scale analysis, while the Turkish Movies dataset adds a localized dimension to the study, making it more relevant to regional audience preferences.\

The combination of both datasets allows us to explore general trends as well as cultural differences in movie genre popularity.\

Moreover, the variety of available variables such as genre, rating, year, runtime, and awards creates multiple opportunities for deeper analytical approaches.

### *2.4 Preprocessing*

Before starting the analysis, we needed to make sure that our dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for use.\
The original *ggplot2movies* dataset and the Turkish Movies dataset were first reviewed separately.\
We noticed that there were slight differences in the available columns, especially in genre categorization and runtime fields.

In order to combine the two datasets properly, we carried out the following preprocessing steps:

-   Selected the relevant columns from both datasets (e.g., title, year, runtime, genre, rating, votes, and award-related fields).

-   Standardized column names and data formats to ensure consistency.

-   Merged the datasets into a single file by aligning the columns.

-   Replaced Turkish-specific characters (such as "ş", "ğ", "ü", "ö", "ç", "ı") with their English equivalents to prevent encoding problems.

-   Filled missing values in fields like runtime and budget using reasonable defaults where needed.

-   Added a new `country` column to differentiate between Global and Turkish movies.

-   At the end of the preprocessing phase, we saved the final version of the dataset as an `.RData` file, making it ready for the subsequent stages of analysis.
