As an **industrial engineer** with a passion for data analysis, broadcasting, and artificial intelligence, I have built my career on exploring innovative solutions in these fields. After graduating from TOBB University, I began working as a data analyst in the broadcasting sector, specifically at TRT1, where I focused on broadcast planning and data analysis.

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in industrial engineering while developing projects that integrate AI and innovation into the broadcasting industry. I also share insights on industry trends through blog writing and continuously work on enhancing my professional expertise.
